# Pet-s-Groove

Pet's Groove is a innovative application we had to design during a IT project management course we were taking for our BSc.
People behind this idea is : Yannis ADDI, Gilles BUCHHEIT, Maxime HAUREL and Etienne SCHNEIDER.

The concept of Pet's Groove is a social network based on music produced by animal movements recorded through a video. Each user has the possibility to 
 - record a video of his animal
 -  visualize the music produced by shape recognition and AI algorithms
 -  edit the video and the music produced
 -  edit the music and add some effects to it for musician-type users
 -  and then publish it to the feed

As you can see, the design is really look-a-like to some applications like TikTok or Instagram and this is wanted because we thought these application were quite ergonomic and it would have been more convenient for users to have a familiar application to use.

We designed this application in adequation to UX principles we learned in cognitive ergnomics course last semester.

You can visualize this application design we made with Figma here (the whole application is still is French for the moment) : https://www.figma.com/file/PCmsHWQnz4ZGiXW0KSAWdS/Pet's-groove?node-id=0%3A1
